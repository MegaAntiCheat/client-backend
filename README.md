# client-backend


The client app for [MAC](https://github.com/MegaAntiCheat)

## Usage steps
1. Download the latest version from [releases](https://github.com/MegaAntiCheat/client-backend/releases), or build the application yourself (if you know what you're doing)
2. Add `-condebug -conclearlog -usercon -g15` to your TF2 launch options (Right click the game in your library -> `Properties...`)
3. Add the following lines to your `autoexec.cfg` file ([learn how to find yours here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3112357964))
```
ip 0.0.0.0
rcon_password mac_rcon
net_start
```
4. If you use mastercomfig, you will have to put your `autoexec.cfg` inside the `overrides` folder instead ([more information](https://docs.mastercomfig.com/9.9.3/customization/custom_configs))
5. Launch TF2
6. Run the application
7. Click on the link in your console window or visit `localhost:3621` in your browser
8. You should get a webpage with the UI in it, prompting for a Steam API key and an RCON password.
9. Get yourself a Steam Web API key from [here](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey)
10. Enter the RCON password you set in your autoexec.
11. When you connect to a match it should show all the players in the match!
12. Navigate to https://megaanticheat.com/provision to get a Masterbase API key. You will need to sign in with your Steam account.
13. In the MegaAntiCheat UI, go to the preferences menu on the left sidebar.
14. Put your Masterbase API key into the respective text field.
15. Click the "Agree to TOS" checkbox and read the terms and conditions before agreeing.
16. Now any demo files you record will be automatically streamed to our central server!
17. Enable automatic demo recordings by going into TF2's advanced options and setting "Recording Mode" to "Auto-record all matches"

## Troubleshooting

- **Rcon connection error in the console window**
  - Ensure your `autoexec.cfg` is executing properly
  - Check step 4 of *Usage steps* if you use Mastercomfig
  - Make sure you haven't accidentally made it `autoexec.cfg.txt` (you might need to [show file extensions](https://www.howtogeek.com/205086/beginner-how-to-make-windows-show-file-extensions/))
  - When you launch TF2, open your console and look for a line that looks like `Network: IP 0.0.0.0, mode MP, dedicated No, ports 27015 SV / 27005 CL`
    - If you see this line, `autoexec.cfg` it is being executed
    - If you do not have this line in your console, your `autoexec.cfg` is not being executed
  - Restart TF2, then paste the commands `ip 0.0.0.0`, `rcon_password mac_rcon` and `net_start` into your console manually
    - Restart client-backend and see if it can connect afterwards
    - If it successfully connects after that, your `autoexec.cfg` file is not executing
  - Another program may be using that port, you can try change the rcon port that MAC will use
    - This is common if you have installed iTunes before
    1. Add`-port 27069` to your TF2 launch options
    2. In the web UI, go to settings and change the port number to `27069`
    3. Restart TF2 and client-backend
- **RCon authentication error**
  - Your rcon password is not being accepted
  - Try change the password you set in your `autoexec.cfg` and update it in the web UI
  - Choose a password that does not contain any spaces or special characters, a single word is fine
  - The password is required to be set but does not have to be secure as nobody else will have access to your Rcon
- **No players show up in the UI when I join a match**
  - Check for an Rcon connection error in the console window and follow the steps above
- **Missing launch options, but I'm not**
  - Run the application with the flag `--ignore-lanch-opts`
- **"No UI is bundled with this version of the app" or Error 404**
  - Use the executable from [releases](https://github.com/MegaAntiCheat/client-backend/releases)
  - If you have compiled the program yourself and *want* to compile it yourself
    - Run the appropriate `include_ui` script before compiling the application
    - This will require [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) to be installed, potentially among other things
    - Make sure it runs properly and doesn't throw any errors, if it does you can delete everything in the `ui` folder and the `ui_temp` folder if it exists
- **Can't locate TF2 directory**
  - Use the command suggested in the error
- **Can't locate Steam directory**
  - If you have previously installed Steam via Flatpak, ensure there are no residual files
  - May be in `~/.var/app/`
- **I can't get an API key because I haven't bought any games**
  - Only premium steam accounts (an account that has purchased something on it) can be issued Steam Web API keys
  - You can enter an empty key to the UI to skip adding a key, the app will still provide most functionality but will not have some features (such as looking up the steam profiles of players)

## Documentation
Documentation for the API can be found at https://github.com/MegaAntiCheat/client-backend/wiki/API-Specification

Config files for the application can be found at:
- Windows: `C:\Users\<Your Name>\AppData\Roaming\MAC\MACClient\config`
- Mac OS: TODO - work out what this is, nobody games on MacOS
- Linux: `~/.config/macclient/`

## Building
1. Install Rust from https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
2. Navigate to inside the project folder using your favourite command line interface
3. Build the UI by running the appropriate `include_ui` script, see the UI section below for more information
4. Run with `cargo run`

### UI
To include the provided frontend, run the `include_ui.sh` (linux/mac) or `include_ui.bat` (windows) before building with cargo. Some dependencies will need to be installed, they can be found [here](https://github.com/MegaAntiCheat/MegaAntiCheat-UI).

Alternatively, a custom web UI can be built into the project by placing any files in the `ui` folder at compile time, and they will be served from the web interface. The web UI should include an `index.html` file as this is where the root URL will redirect to.

File are served starting from `http://127.0.0.1:3621/ui/`.
